In most cases, you will actually write Python scripts to do the work that you want to do. We'll spen a few moments talking about how to continue using python in order to accomplish your learning/research/work goals."

In some cases, you will need to be explicit about which interpreter you use, say you have more than one installed on your system. In that case you would write `#!/pathToPython` replacing **pathToPython** with whatever version of python you want to use. \n",

This is one reason that writing functions and classes are so important because in the same way that you import functions from the standard modules, you can also import functions from your own code. As long as that code is in your `pythonpath` you can simply use an import statement along with the name of your script (minus the .py). However, in order to do this you need to make sure that the script itself doesn't exectute. We do this by using the followin if statement:"
