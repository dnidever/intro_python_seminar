    "Functions are a way of containing lines of code in discrete separable units. They are useful because if a block of code needs to be used more than once in a module or in another module, you don't have to write it multiple times. This makes developing and debugging code much easier as well because you only need change the code in one place instead of multiple times. Functions are like objects in that they can be used as arguments to other functions and be stored in sequences.\n",

This is true for any kind of code block whether it be an if statement, a loop, or a function. In general people use 4 space to indent (most programming text editors use 4 spaces when you hit tab).

The rules for assignment work the same way in a fuction as they do outside of a fuction as far as mutable and immutable objects are concerned.
